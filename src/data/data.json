    "Join us on June 26 for the latest Global Forum event where <em>The Economist</em>'s influential Schumpeter Columnist Adrian Wooldridge will discuss his new book, <em>The Great Disruption</em>. The book by Wooldridge, who is also management editor for <em>The Economist</em>, has a hint of optimism in its subtitle: \"How Business Is Coping With Turbulent Times.\"",
    "The term \"The Great Disruption\" refers to what the online Urban Dictionary calls \"a frightening new historical era that began in 2008 with the crash of world economies and the simultaneous collapse of trust in governing institutions.\" Wooldridge's book, a collection of his Schumpeter columns, is described as \"addressing the causes and profound consequences of the unprecedented disruption of business over the past five years.\""
