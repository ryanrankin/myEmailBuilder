    "As Executive Director of the Crow Collection of Asian Art, Amy Lewis Hofland leads the preeminent museum dedicated to the works of China, Japan, India, Korea and Southwest Asia in the southern United States. On staff since the Crow Collection’s inception in 1998, Hofland’s footprint can be found throughout the museum’s offerings.",
    "Under her leadership, the Crow Collection implemented two wildly successful monthly community-focused programs: Adventure Asia: Family Days at the Crow and Crow Collection After Dark, which combined drew over 30,000 people last year to learn about the arts and cultures of Asia. An art educator at heart, Hofland served as a teacher at Armstrong Elementary School in Highland Park, Texas, before a stint at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a graduate student led her to the museum world. Hofland holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the University of Texas at Austin and a Master of Arts degree in art education from the University of North Texas, where she was part of the distinguished Marcus Fellow program. In addition to her work at the Crow Collection, Hofland is a noted author, speaker and community leader serving on various board leadership positions in the Dallas-Fort Worth community."
